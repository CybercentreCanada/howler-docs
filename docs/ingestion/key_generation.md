# Generating an API key

While integrating Howler into another system, you should not save your username and password into another app. Instead, you should create an API Key with only the appropriate requirements for that specific integration.

## Creating an API key

1. Login to Howler's user interface with the user that will perform API requests
1. Click on your avatar in the top-right corner of the Howler UI and select "Settings"
1. Scroll down to the bottom to the "User Security" section and press the plus button.
1. Add the API Key name, select access privileges and expiry dates then click the "Create" button.
1. The API Key will only be displayed once and can't be recovered. Copy it somewhere safe so that you can use it later.
1. Close the Drawer.
